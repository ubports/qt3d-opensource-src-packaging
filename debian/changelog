qt3d-opensource-src (5.9.1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Simon Quigley ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add new upstream files to qt3d-gltfsceneio-plugin, making it contain
    all gltf-related files.
  * Qt 3D GL Assimp scene IO plugin was renamed upstream, adjust
    accordingly.
  * QTBUG-57543 was fixed, and we can ship the planets example now. Drop
    do_not_build_planets_example.patch.
  * Add the following packages from new upstream files:
    - qml-module-qtquick-scene2d
    - libqt53dquickscene2d5
    - libqt53danimation5
    - libqt53dquickanimation5
    - qt3d-defaultgeometryloader-plugin
    - qt3d-scene2d-plugin

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Move qgltf executable to qt3d-gltfsceneio-plugin package.
  * Migrate to automatic dbgsym packages.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Update symbols files from the current amd64 build log.
  * Update the license for ConvertUTF code in debian/copyright according
    to upstream relicensing. Override the Lintian error about it.
  * Temporarily build with bundled Assimp. We cannot use the packaged
    Assimp because Qt 3D needs some changes which were added after v3.3.1.
  * Override false positive Lintian license-problem-json-evil error.
  * Bump Qt build-dependencies to 5.9.1.
  * Remove some non-free example assets from the tarball.
    - Disable code which was using them (nonfree_resources.diff).
  * Drop Build-Conflicts on qtmultimedia5-dev, not needed with this patch.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.0.0, no changes needed.
  * Backport a patch to fix Assimp build on big endian architectures
    (assimp_big_endian.diff).
  * Make qt3d5-examples depend on qml-module-qt3d (closes: #850470).

qt3d-opensource-src (5.7.1+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make qt3d5-dev Recommend qt3d5-doc[-html] (Closes: #849980).
    Thanks Ben Finney for the bug report.
  * Make libqt3d5-dev depend upon all the libraries shipped by the source
    package (Closes: #852524). Thanks Johannes Schauer for the bug report.
  * Update symbols files with buildds' logs.

qt3d-opensource-src (5.7.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream final release.
    - Bump Qt build dependencies.
  * Add libgl1-mesa-dri as a test build dependency to avoid the message
    "libEGL warning: DRI2: failed to open swrast".
  * Add <!nocheck> to build dependencies used at test time.
    - Bump debhelper dependency to >= 9.20141010~ to allow build profiles to
      work.
  * Make tests non-fatal. We currently only have one failing on some archs,
    but it's a test issue as it doesn't fails if run alone (Closes: #847821).

qt3d-opensource-src (5.7.1~20161122+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Bump Qt build dependencies.
  * Bump Standards-Version, no changes required.
  * Update packaging:
    - Libs with "Renderer" changed it's name to "Render". This changes
      SONAME but there are still no rdeps in the archive.
    - Documentation is now shipped under qt3d/.
    - libqt3d5collision5 is not shipped anymore.
    - Ship libqt3dquickinput5.
    - gltfsceneparser now has an auxiliary binary.
    - Regenerate symbols files for all libs. This makes handling both the
      SONAME change and the symbols's nodes changes easier. We still have no
      reverse dependencies to care for.
  * Use secure URLs for the repos.
  * Fix duplicated short description.
  * Update debian/copyright.
    - Do not ship examples/qt3d/planets-qml/images/*, they are clearly
      non-free.
  * Add extensions to xvfb-run needed by tests.
  * Run only one test at a time, this seems to make qaspectengine's
    setRootEntity work.
  * Rename qt3d-gltfsceneparser-plugin to qt3d-gltfsceneio-plugin and
    qt3d-assimpsceneparser-plugin to qt3d-assimpsceneio-plugin following
    upstream's changes.
  * Re do symbols files, this is the first API/ABI stable version that gets
    into Debian.
  * Do not build planets-qml example due to the lack of the required images,
    as we need to remove them from the tarball for being undistributable.

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Exclude audio-visualizer-qml example from the tarball because it contains
    a non-free MP3 file (CC BY-ND 2.0).
    - Add qtmultimedia5-dev to Build-Conflicts to make sure that example is
      not built.
    - Tell uscan to repack the tarball.
  * Add some new symbols that appeared in 5.6.1.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8, no changes needed.

qt3d-opensource-src (5.5.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    which is dragged in by qtbase5-dev (Closes: #817793).
  * Add qml-module-qtquick-scene3d as a qt3d5-examples' dependency, needed
    by qt3d's controls.
